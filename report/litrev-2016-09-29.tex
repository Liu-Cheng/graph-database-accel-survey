\section{Accelerator Design for Graph Analytics}
This paper \cite{ozdal2016energy} is essentially a graph accelerator implementation framework of Gather-Apply-Scatter model as in
GraphLab. It particularly focuses on iterative graph-parallel applications with asynchronous
execution and asymmetric convergence. In order to support domain of graph processing, it has a
template of hardware for common operations including memory access, synchronization and
communication. In order to provide application specific optimization, a design space exploration is
also supported like typical domain specific accelerators.

\subsection{Highlights}
Here are the list of highlights of this work.
\begin{itemize}
    \item It targets graph applications with asynchronous execution and asymmetric convergence which
        doesn't work well on GPUs.
    \item It developed a synchronous unit (SYU) to support sequential consistency model. 
\end{itemize}
